# The Algorithms - Collection of Problems

This repository is a collection of Python scripts designed to efficiently solve algorithmic problems[^1], with the purpose of practicing how to approach similar problems. As a self-taught programmer, please note that the solutions presented here may not be perfect and are subject to improvement. In the future, problem-solving scripts in Rust may be also included to expand the project's scope and provide more diverse and optimized solutions to algorithmic problems.

[^1]: Most problems come from or are inspired by [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems. If so, the files themselves will most likely include the link and/or a brief exemplified description of the problem in question.
