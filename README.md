# Python Algorithm Script Compendium

This repository is a collection of Python scripts designed to efficiently solve algorithmic problems, with the purpose of practicing how to approach similar problems. As a self-taught programmer, please note that the solutions presented here may not be perfect and are subject to improvement. In the future, problem-solving scripts in Rust may be also included to expand the project's scope and provide more diverse and optimized solutions to algorithmic problems.
